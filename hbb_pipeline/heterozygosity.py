"""Secondary peak detection and zygosity classification.

Two-level API:
  1. get_two_peaks() — pre-alignment, per-position secondary peak
     detection using a rule-based slope filter.  Used by
     apply_iupac_symbols() to IUPAC-code the trace before alignment.
  2. detect_secondary_peaks() / classify_zygosity() — post-call, used to
     assign HOM/HET/UNKNOWN to variants already called from the consensus.
